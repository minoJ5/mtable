<h1>mTable</h1>
mTable is a datagrid for the browser written in Typescript 

<h2>Description</h2>
This is a recreational project I work on when I have the time. It is still not finished and there are still things (like virtualization) than need to be added. 

<h4>List of Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Spawn a table from json.
  <li> Resisable table columns.
  <li> Cell and range selection with automatic scrolling.
  <li> Editable cells.
  <li> Multiple column filter (sort of works).
  <li> Column sorting (only alphanumerical, i.e, 100 is smaller than 20).
  <li> Custom context menus.
</ul>

<h4>Future goals:</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Virtualization.
  <li> Code refactoring and improvements.
  <li> Keyboard shortcuts.
</ul>
